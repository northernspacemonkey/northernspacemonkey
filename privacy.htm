    <p>
        The Northern Space Monkey site doesn't collect any information, utilise any of your information or give a monkey's butthole about trying to gain any of your information. 
        Feel free to use the site, browse around, read articles and information without fear that I'm coming after your first born child, trying to sign you up to medication shilling 
        ambulance chasers or trying to discover the inner-most fears of your mind.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the right to click off the site, you have the right to remain silent, you have the right to scream expletives at the computer screen if you so desire. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are unhappy that I'm not swiping your details and tracking your every waking moment then feel free to fire an email to privacy @ northernspacemonkey.co.uk and I'll 
        send you a picture of a banana in space. It will be a composite, don't expect me to actually send a banana to space and take a photo, I'm not a gazillionaire!
    </p>
    <p>
        I am not a business, I am not treating you as a consumer (although you are entitled to consume printouts of my site, I just would not recommend you do so as the ink and paper 
        might cause medical issues that I accept zero liability for. If you are an idiot and choose to nom printouts, that's on you for thinking it's a good idea).
