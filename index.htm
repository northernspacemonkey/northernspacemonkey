    <h3>SpaceX Dragon reboost of ISS</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/issRussian.png" class="articleImage" title="ISS Image" alt="ISS Image" />
   <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">SpaceX</span> has managed to successfully reboost the ISS with their Dragon spacecraft, 
        raising the perigee of the orbit by approximately one mile. The initial test burn maneuver lasted five minutes and three seconds 
        with the team planning to use the reboost kit again for a series of longer burns. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The reboost kit consists of two Draco engines and is isolated from the rest of the spacecraft. The test was intended to show that the 
        vehicle can maintain the ISS altitude, reducing the reliance on Russian rockets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Northrop Grumman's Cygnus cargo spacecraft is also able to perform limited reboosts, with SpaceX Dragon having proven it is capable of using 
        it's own engines to nudge the ISS also.
    </p>
    <p>
        The success of the reboost will be of a huge relief with the Russian space programme in decline and concerns over future missions growing.

    <h3>UK Space Agency to be absorbed into DSIT</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/uksa.png" class="articleImage" title="UK Space Agency" alt="UK Space Agency" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">UKSA</span> , the UK Space Agency, is pencilled to collapse into the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology 
        as part of government drives to cut red-tape, &quot;cutting duplication, reducing bureaucracy and putting public accountability at the heart of 
        decision making&quot; (read &quot;reduce cash in government spending&quot; )
    </p>
    <p>
        The DSIT will absorb UKSA by April 2026, sharing staffing but leaving the UKSA name intact. The UKSA was founded in 2010 as an &quot;executive agency&quot; 
        of DSIT and the move to merge into DSIT is in preference to making it a ministry in it's own right. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Companies working with the UKSA are requesting clarification of the government's plans, worried that the wider scientific grouping might lead to 
        the loss of attention to current projects and partnerships. 
    </p>
    <p>
       Sir Chris Bryant, Minister of State for Data Protection and Telecoms (which covers the UKSA) said &quot;You don't need to be a rocket scientist to see the importance of space to the British economy. Bringing things in house means we can bring much 
       greater integration and focus to everything we are doing while maintaining the scientific expertise and the immense ambition of the sector.&quot; 
    </p>
    <p>
        The proof, as always, will be in the pudding... er, merging...

    <h3>MetOp-SG-A1 Launch</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/metopsat.png" class="articleImage" title="Metop-SG-A1 Satellite in orbit render" alt="Metop-SG-A1" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Weather</span> and climate monitoring is a (no pun intended) hot topic of late and the launch of ESA's new polar-orbiting satellite series began with the 
        MetOp-SG-A1 (second generation) aboard an Ariane 6 rocket.
    </p>
    <p>
        Packed with a range of new equipment, the satellite will be able to deliver critical data on air pollutants, ozone and climate-related gases. ESA's site delivers more information on the new platforms:
    </p>
    <p>
        &quot;The all-new MetOp-SG mission comprises three successive pairs of satellites. Each MetOp-SG pair is made up of an A-type and a B-type satellite that carry a different, 
        but complementary, suite of remarkable instruments to capture a wide range of observations.&quot;<br/>
        &quot;This first satellite is an A-type, MetOp-SG-A1, which includes the Sentinel-5 spectrometer for Copernicus - the Earth observation component of the European Unionâ€™s space programme.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
        ESA's Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonette Cheli commented:<br/>
        &quot;With increasingly erratic weather patterns, timely and precise forecasting has never been more crucial, and the MetOp-SG mission is now set to play a critical role in improving weather forecasts and climate monitoring. Sentinel-5 
        too will bring timely data for air pollution monitoring and more&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       More information on the mission can be found on the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Meteorological_missions/MetOp_Second_Generation/First_MetOp-SG_and_Sentinel-5_launched" target="metopwin">ESA mission site for MetOp</a>.
