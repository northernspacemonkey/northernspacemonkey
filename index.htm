    <h3>Anniversary of the Moon Landing</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/moon1969.png" class="articleImage" title="Moon Landing" alt="Moon Landing" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Today</span> marks the 56th anniversary of the 1969 Moon Landing, our first step on another world made at a time where scientific endevour was 
        encouraged, brave men and women stepped into the unknown for the betterment of humanity and engineering was blossoming. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Fifty six years since three men strapped themselves to the biggest pile of explosives and, having watched their friends sadly pass away on the launchpad not long before, launched towards our nearest celestial body. They accepted the risk, 
            they pushed forward, reaching for the stars. 
        </p>
        <p>
           It's with bitter taste therefore, that on the 56th anniversary we see such crushing decline in the investment to NASA, a drive towards &quot;entertainment&quot; and not discovery, 
           and the lack of enthusiasm for selfless pioneering. 
        </p>
        <p>
           The Earth science and deep-space planetary missions have been some of the hardest hit in this year's budget. Understanding our planet and the cosmos is not, it seems, 
           the in-thing. Employees that are watching their missions drop into the cull list are considering partnering with other space agencies to continue their breakthrough scientific work, 
            hoping that they can continue their work elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
           On a weekend where we should be celebrating the heroic efforts to reach-out and engineer a way to other worlds, we see sadness and loss on the picket lines.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is much to celebrate and champion in our reach to place footprints on another world, much to remind us that together we can do great things to the betterment of all. This anniversary, 
            I remember and salute all the engineers, scientists, mathematicians, seamstresses, doctors and interns who worked on a common goal doing their part in a bigger picture. They may not have their own 
            footprint on the moon, but their fingerprints are all over the missions. You made a difference to the bigger mission, turning the impossible dream into an actual reality.

    <h3>U.S. Military Weather Satellite Shutdown</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/dmsp-5d2-f14.png" class="articleImage" title="DMSP Satellite" alt="DMSP Satellite" />
        <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Weather</span> satellites are key to the prediction of patterns and meteorological event warning for the civilian population. 
        For many years the U.S. Defense Meteorological Satellite Programme (DMSP) and it's data products have supported weather prediction programmes, helping to 
        provide tracking and warning of a range of weather patterns, including hurricane prediction due to the additional microwave imaging unit.
    </p>
    <p>
        In an unexpected change to policy, the satellites have been decomissioned from public usage and access to data services removed for the general public. This has led to the loss 
        of critical tracking data right before the main hurricane season in the U.S. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Citing &quot;recent service changes&quot; as the reason, the world is left speculating around why the out-of-the-blue change has occurred, with other strange 
        announcements around &quot;cyber security risks to the Navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Centre&quot; and not being budget-related.
    </p>
    <p>
       With the shutdown dropped on the community last-minute and slated for the end of June, NOAA further announced a repreave on the 27th June to provide data until the 31st July.

    <h3>MethaneSAT Loses Contact with Satellite</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/methanesat.png" class="articleImage" title="MethaneSAT Satellite" alt="MethaneSAT Satellite" />
        <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Space</span> is a harsh and difficult environment to operate in, with the potential for problems each orbit. 
        To the teams designing and operating equipment, my greatest admiration and respect for your abilities and greatest sympathy for your losses. 
        </p>
        <p>
           On Friday the 20th June, MethaneSAT mission operations suffered the heart-wrenching loss of contact with their MethaneSAT craft, after fifteen months 
           in orbit. After attempting to re-establish communications with the satellite it became evident that the craft had suffered a power loss which looks to be 
           unrecoverable.
        </p>
        <p>
           The mission has provided a wealth of data on methane emissions over the past year, with it's advanced instrumentation tracking methane emissions in the 
           oil and gas producing regions of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            The spectrometers developed specifically for MethaneSAT met or exceeded expectations throughout it's mission allowing the team to 
            measure volumes of methane emissions from the smallest generation to large-scale installations. The data derived helping to provide a greater 
            overall picture of greenhouse gas emissions.
