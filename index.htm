    <h3>ISS Leak Continues</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/issRussian.png" class="articleImage" title="ISS Image" alt="ISS Image" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Leaking</span> air to space isn't something you want to have happen for long, however it seems the Russian segment on the ISS is, six years later, 
        still encountering issues despite best efforts to stem the flow.
    </p>
    <p>
        The crew aboard the ISS are not in danger at this point, due to ongoing work to find and seal the leaks, however it raises serious questions around sealing-off the section 
        of the ISS that continues to leak which, being that it's in the Service Module Transfer Tunnel, means the loss of a Russian docking port. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The loss of the docking port is not critical, though it is not ideal. The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, would understandably prefer to retain the use of the module for future missions. 
        Roscosmos and NASA continue to track down the root cause of the leak to hopefully seal the module as well as ensure similar issues do not occur on any future missions.
    </p>
    <p>
       Whilst the leak was hoped to have been fixed in recent remedial work, it appears that the loss of air continues, albeit at a slower pace. The rate of loss in 2024 was deemed to be a significant 
       concern, described as a &quot;top safety risk&quot; by NASA.

    <h3>DMSP Service Continues</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/dmsp-5d2-f14.png" class="articleImage" title="DMSP Satellite" alt="DMSP Satellite" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">FNMOC</span> has finally turned around their decision to cease the DMSP data feed at the end of July 2025. After several months of service concerns the 
        Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center has agreed to continue providing data for the duration of the program's lifespan.
    </p>
    <p>
        In an official statement the U.S. Navy spokesman commented &quot;The center [FNMOC] had planned to phase out the data as part of a Defense Department 
        modernization effort. But after feedback from government partners, officials found a way to meet modernization goals while keeping the data flowing until 
        the sensor fails or the program formally ends in September 2026.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
        The continuation of services will leave weather forecasters extremely relieved after concerns over the lack of data through the hheight of the hurricane season. 
    </p>
    <p>
       Despite the data switch-off at times throughout the process, the amateur community rallied to find a way to retrieve data directly from the satellite provided you had 
       sufficient equipment. A decoder was even <a href="https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump" target="SatDump">generated and provided through Github</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next query for the weather teams will be around what happens in 2026 at the end of the program.

    <h3>Juno mission team remotely fixes hardware</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/junospacecraft.png" class="articleImage" title="Juno Spacecraft Render" alt="Juno Spacecraft Render" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">NASA's</span> mission team for the Juno spacecraft executed a repair of the JunoCam imager to capture photographs of the Jovian moon Io in December 2023 it has been revealed.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Nuclear &amp; Space Radiation Effects Conference in Nashville, the repair process and results were detailed to delegates.
        </p>
        <p>
           JunoCam is a colour, visible-light camera that has it's optical unit located outside a titanium-walled radiation vault, which protects sensitive electronic 
           components for many of Juno's engineering and science instruments. The vault is designed to protect against intense planetary radiation fields that Juno travels through 
           in our solar system. Whilst mission designers were confident JunoCam could operate through the first eight orbits of Jupiter, it was uncertain how long the instrument would 
           last after that.
        </p>
        <p>
           Throughout the prime mission of thirty-four orbits, JunoCam operated normally, however on the forty-seventh orbit the imager began showing hints of radiation damage. By the fifty-sixth orbit, 
           almost all of the images were corrupted.
        </p>
        <p>
           The team analysed the output and craft data with clues pointing to a damaged voltage regulator vital to JunoCam's power supply. With very few options for recovery, the team turned to an annealing process, 
           where material is heated for a period of time before slowly cooling. The process is not well understood, however the idea is that heating can reduce defects in a material.
        </p>
        <p>
           The team sent the command to Juno to set the JunoCam heater to raise the camera temperature to 77 degrees Fahrenheit (much warmer than typical for JunoCam) and awaited the results. Soon after the 
           annealing process finished, JunoCam began to deliver crisp images for several orbits.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;After orbit 55, our images were full of streaks and noise, we tried different schemes for processing the images to improve the quality, but nothing worked. With the close encounter of Io bearing down 
            on us in a few weeks, it was Hail Mary time: The only thing left we hadn't tried was to crank JunoCam's heater all the way up and see if the more extreme annealing would save us.&quot; said JunoCam instrument lead, 
            Michael Ravine of Malin Space Science Systems.
