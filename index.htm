    <h3>Rocket Debris in Australia</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/chinaRocket.png" class="articleImage" title="Chinese Rocket Image" alt="Chinese Rocket Image" />
   <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Debris</span> found smoldering in Western Australia is most likely a part of a Chinese rocket. Mine workers found 
        a mysterious smoking pile near an access road east of Newman on Saturday. Police and the Australian Space Agency are investigating, with 
        early findings suggesting the carbon fiber wreckage is part of a Chinese rocket.
    </p>
    <p>
        Being found still burning, it was likely from a recent impact and ties-in with a Smart Dragon 3 rocket that fell back to Earth on October 18th.
    </p>
    <p>
        The object resembles a composite overwrapped pressure vessel which holds high-pressure gases and liquids inside rockets and often survive reentry.
    </p>
    <p>
        Marco Langbroek, a specialist on astrodynamics and space missions on the faculty of aerospace engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands 
        stated &quot;It could actually be the upper stage itself, given the large size that the photos suggest&quot;

    <h3>British Space Industry History</h3>

    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">British</span> space programs have been operating for 70 years, despite the lack of media highlighting. In a beautifully presented 
        history section of their website, Space South Central have provided a 
        <a href="https://www.spacesouthcentral.com/our-space-heritage" target="SpaceSouthWin">history of the innovation and technical progress Britain has made since 1955</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Walking through seventy years of progress, it's striking how many world-first moments the British engineering teams have achieved. 
    </p>
    <p>
        From early days with rocketry, through the development of highly adaptable satellite technology, it's good to see the forward-thinking progress 
        driving innovation around the world.

    <h3>Discovery Shuttle Move</h3>
     <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/discoveryshuttle.png" class="articleImage" title="Discovery Image" alt="Discovery Image" />
	<p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Discovery</span> is the most intact shuttle orbiter of the NASA program, with significant 
        historical value. When it was moved and parked at the national collection it was never anticipated to be moved again. 
        However, in the recently passed US reconcilliation bill, there is a clause requiring the movement of a flown space vehicle to 
        Houston, Texas. That, is unfortunately, marked as Discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no easy way to move Discovery, with transport aircraft out of service and no accessible water transportation available. The 
        only way possible at this stage looks to be the disassembly of the vehicle and reassembly at the other end. On a craft that was never 
        meant to be taken to pieces. With fragile heat tiles and worn airframes.
