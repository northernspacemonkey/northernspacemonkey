    <h2>Adventures in Tech and Space</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">The Northern Space Monkey</span> is a systems engineer working in the space industry. On a daily basis NSM is communicating with Low Earth Orbit satellite equipment and ground stations across the planet. In the course of their work they find interesting things to talk about, investigate and create solutions for. 
        This site is the combination of notes written on scraps of paper, conversations with peers, and development work undertken so that I can keep a record of fun or interesting findings providing useful support to help myself and others in their adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested in all things space, talking to spacecraft, and doing fun things with data feeds from orbital craft, then this is the place for you! Welcome, fellow geek, to The Northern Space Monkey's playground. Grab a cup of coffee and join me on this journey of discovery, tinkering and laughter.
