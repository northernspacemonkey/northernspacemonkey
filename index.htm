    <h3>Chinese Astronauts Delayed Return</h3>
     <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/chinaRocket.png" class="articleImage" title="Chinese Space Agency Rocket" alt="Chinese Space Agency Image" />
	<p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Three</span> of China's taikonauts (Wang Jie, Chen Zhongrui and Chen Dong) are currently having an unscheduled extension to their stay 
        aboard the Tiangong space station after their return capsule was struck by space debris.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to return to Earth on Wednesday, the taikonauts have been aboard the space station since April 24th, known as the Shenzhou-20 crew, and recently handing over the baton to the 21 crew. 
        It is likely that they will have to utilise the 21 crew's vehicle for reentry depending on the status of the systems on the damaged delivery vehicle, which is of similar 
        design to the Russian Soyuz capsules.
    </p>
    <p>
        The crews are safe and able to continue operating in orbit at the moment with assessments of the damaged vehicle scheduled to take place. China may decide to send up a replacement 
        craft for the Shenzhou-21 crew and bring the Shenzhou-20 crew back in the currently docked Shenzhou-21 vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's not the first time the Tiangong space station has suffered from orbital debris damage, previously encountereing power system issues with damaged solar arrays. With the quantity of junk, debris and 
        old equipment increasing in Low Earth Orbit, it's no wonder orbital platforms are encountering issues when a speck of paint at orbital velocity can blast through craft.

    <h3>Rocket Debris in Australia</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/chinaRocket.png" class="articleImage" title="Chinese Rocket Image" alt="Chinese Rocket Image" />
   <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Debris</span> found smoldering in Western Australia is most likely a part of a Chinese rocket. Mine workers found 
        a mysterious smoking pile near an access road east of Newman on Saturday. Police and the Australian Space Agency are investigating, with 
        early findings suggesting the carbon fiber wreckage is part of a Chinese rocket.
    </p>
    <p>
        Being found still burning, it was likely from a recent impact and ties-in with a Smart Dragon 3 rocket that fell back to Earth on October 18th.
    </p>
    <p>
        The object resembles a composite overwrapped pressure vessel which holds high-pressure gases and liquids inside rockets and often survive reentry.
    </p>
    <p>
        Marco Langbroek, a specialist on astrodynamics and space missions on the faculty of aerospace engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands 
        stated &quot;It could actually be the upper stage itself, given the large size that the photos suggest&quot;

    <h3>British Space Industry History</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">

    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">British</span> space programs have been operating for 70 years, despite the lack of media highlighting. In a beautifully presented 
        history section of their website, Space South Central have provided a 
        <a href="https://www.spacesouthcentral.com/our-space-heritage" target="SpaceSouthWin">history of the innovation and technical progress Britain has made since 1955</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Walking through seventy years of progress, it's striking how many world-first moments the British engineering teams have achieved. 
    </p>
    <p>
        From early days with rocketry, through the development of highly adaptable satellite technology, it's good to see the forward-thinking progress 
        driving innovation around the world.
