    <h3>DMSP Service Continues</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/dmsp-5d2-f14.png" class="articleImage" title="DMSP Satellite" alt="DMSP Satellite" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">FNMOC</span> has finally turned around their decision to cease the DMSP data feed at the end of July 2025. After several months of service concerns the 
        Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center has agreed to continue providing data for the duration of the program's lifespan.
    </p>
    <p>
        In an official statement the U.S. Navy spokesman commented &quot;The center [FNMOC] had planned to phase out the data as part of a Defense Department 
        modernization effort. But after feedback from government partners, officials found a way to meet modernization goals while keeping the data flowing until 
        the sensor fails or the program formally ends in September 2026.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
        The continuation of services will leave weather forecasters extremely relieved after concerns over the lack of data through the hheight of the hurricane season. 
    </p>
    <p>
       Despite the data switch-off at times throughout the process, the amateur community rallied to find a way to retrieve data directly from the satellite provided you had 
       sufficient equipment. A decoder was even <a href="https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump" target="SatDump">generated and provided through Github</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next query for the weather teams will be around what happens in 2026 at the end of the program.

    <h3>Juno mission team remotely fixes hardware</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/junospacecraft.png" class="articleImage" title="Juno Spacecraft Render" alt="Juno Spacecraft Render" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">NASA's</span> mission team for the Juno spacecraft executed a repair of the JunoCam imager to capture photographs of the Jovian moon Io in December 2023 it has been revealed.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Nuclear &amp; Space Radiation Effects Conference in Nashville, the repair process and results were detailed to delegates.
        </p>
        <p>
           JunoCam is a colour, visible-light camera that has it's optical unit located outside a titanium-walled radiation vault, which protects sensitive electronic 
           components for many of Juno's engineering and science instruments. The vault is designed to protect against intense planetary radiation fields that Juno travels through 
           in our solar system. Whilst mission designers were confident JunoCam could operate through the first eight orbits of Jupiter, it was uncertain how long the instrument would 
           last after that.
        </p>
        <p>
           Throughout the prime mission of thirty-four orbits, JunoCam operated normally, however on the forty-seventh orbit the imager began showing hints of radiation damage. By the fifty-sixth orbit, 
           almost all of the images were corrupted.
        </p>
        <p>
           The team analysed the output and craft data with clues pointing to a damaged voltage regulator vital to JunoCam's power supply. With very few options for recovery, the team turned to an annealing process, 
           where material is heated for a period of time before slowly cooling. The process is not well understood, however the idea is that heating can reduce defects in a material.
        </p>
        <p>
           The team sent the command to Juno to set the JunoCam heater to raise the camera temperature to 77 degrees Fahrenheit (much warmer than typical for JunoCam) and awaited the results. Soon after the 
           annealing process finished, JunoCam began to deliver crisp images for several orbits.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;After orbit 55, our images were full of streaks and noise, we tried different schemes for processing the images to improve the quality, but nothing worked. With the close encounter of Io bearing down 
            on us in a few weeks, it was Hail Mary time: The only thing left we hadn't tried was to crank JunoCam's heater all the way up and see if the more extreme annealing would save us.&quot; said JunoCam instrument lead, 
            Michael Ravine of Malin Space Science Systems.

    <h3>Anniversary of the Moon Landing</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/moon1969.png" class="articleImage" title="Moon Landing" alt="Moon Landing" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Today</span> marks the 56th anniversary of the 1969 Moon Landing, our first step on another world made at a time where scientific endevour was 
        encouraged, brave men and women stepped into the unknown for the betterment of humanity and engineering was blossoming. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Fifty six years since three men strapped themselves to the biggest pile of explosives and, having watched their friends sadly pass away on the launchpad not long before, launched towards our nearest celestial body. They accepted the risk, 
            they pushed forward, reaching for the stars. 
        </p>
        <p>
           It's with bitter taste therefore, that on the 56th anniversary we see such crushing decline in the investment to NASA, a drive towards &quot;entertainment&quot; and not discovery, 
           and the lack of enthusiasm for selfless pioneering. 
        </p>
        <p>
           The Earth science and deep-space planetary missions have been some of the hardest hit in this year's budget. Understanding our planet and the cosmos is not, it seems, 
           the in-thing. Employees that are watching their missions drop into the cull list are considering partnering with other space agencies to continue their breakthrough scientific work, 
            hoping that they can continue their work elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
           On a weekend where we should be celebrating the heroic efforts to reach-out and engineer a way to other worlds, we see sadness and loss on the picket lines.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is much to celebrate and champion in our reach to place footprints on another world, much to remind us that together we can do great things to the betterment of all. This anniversary, 
            I remember and salute all the engineers, scientists, mathematicians, seamstresses, doctors and interns who worked on a common goal doing their part in a bigger picture. They may not have their own 
            footprint on the moon, but their fingerprints are all over the missions. You made a difference to the bigger mission, turning the impossible dream into an actual reality.
