    <h3>MetOp-SG-A1 Launch</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/metopsat.png" class="articleImage" title="Metop-SG-A1 Satellite in orbit render" alt="Metop-SG-A1" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Weather</span> and climate monitoring is a (no pun intended) hot topic of late and the launch of ESA's new polar-orbiting satellite series began with the 
        MetOp-SG-A1 (second generation) aboard an Ariane 6 rocket.
    </p>
    <p>
        Packed with a range of new equipment, the satellite will be able to deliver critical data on air pollutants, ozone and climate-related gases. ESA's site delivers more information on the new platforms:
    </p>
    <p>
        &quot;The all-new MetOp-SG mission comprises three successive pairs of satellites. Each MetOp-SG pair is made up of an A-type and a B-type satellite that carry a different, 
        but complementary, suite of remarkable instruments to capture a wide range of observations.&quot;<br/>
        &quot;This first satellite is an A-type, MetOp-SG-A1, which includes the Sentinel-5 spectrometer for Copernicus - the Earth observation component of the European Unionâ€™s space programme.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
        ESA's Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonette Cheli commented:<br/>
        &quot;With increasingly erratic weather patterns, timely and precise forecasting has never been more crucial, and the MetOp-SG mission is now set to play a critical role in improving weather forecasts and climate monitoring. Sentinel-5 
        too will bring timely data for air pollution monitoring and more&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
       More information on the mission can be found on the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Meteorological_missions/MetOp_Second_Generation/First_MetOp-SG_and_Sentinel-5_launched" target="metopwin">ESA mission site for MetOp</a>.

    <h3>ISS Leak Continues</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/issRussian.png" class="articleImage" title="ISS Image" alt="ISS Image" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Leaking</span> air to space isn't something you want to have happen for long, however it seems the Russian segment on the ISS is, six years later, 
        still encountering issues despite best efforts to stem the flow.
    </p>
    <p>
        The crew aboard the ISS are not in danger at this point, due to ongoing work to find and seal the leaks, however it raises serious questions around sealing-off the section 
        of the ISS that continues to leak which, being that it's in the Service Module Transfer Tunnel, means the loss of a Russian docking port. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The loss of the docking port is not critical, though it is not ideal. The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, would understandably prefer to retain the use of the module for future missions. 
        Roscosmos and NASA continue to track down the root cause of the leak to hopefully seal the module as well as ensure similar issues do not occur on any future missions.
    </p>
    <p>
       Whilst the leak was hoped to have been fixed in recent remedial work, it appears that the loss of air continues, albeit at a slower pace. The rate of loss in 2024 was deemed to be a significant 
       concern, described as a &quot;top safety risk&quot; by NASA.

    <h3>DMSP Service Continues</h3>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/dmsp-5d2-f14.png" class="articleImage" title="DMSP Satellite" alt="DMSP Satellite" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">FNMOC</span> has finally turned around their decision to cease the DMSP data feed at the end of July 2025. After several months of service concerns the 
        Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center has agreed to continue providing data for the duration of the program's lifespan.
    </p>
    <p>
        In an official statement the U.S. Navy spokesman commented &quot;The center [FNMOC] had planned to phase out the data as part of a Defense Department 
        modernization effort. But after feedback from government partners, officials found a way to meet modernization goals while keeping the data flowing until 
        the sensor fails or the program formally ends in September 2026.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
        The continuation of services will leave weather forecasters extremely relieved after concerns over the lack of data through the hheight of the hurricane season. 
    </p>
    <p>
       Despite the data switch-off at times throughout the process, the amateur community rallied to find a way to retrieve data directly from the satellite provided you had 
       sufficient equipment. A decoder was even <a href="https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump" target="SatDump">generated and provided through Github</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next query for the weather teams will be around what happens in 2026 at the end of the program.
