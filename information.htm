	<p>
	This October in the northern hemisphere we were provided an amazing aurora display on the evening of the 10th. 
	In previous scheduled viewing periods, it always seemed to transpire that the skies were filled with rainclouds for me but this year I finally managed 
	to get some photographs of the event. I’ve always wanted to head further northward to experience the phenomenon in full, somewhere like Lapland with the 
	stark beauty of the landscape and the vast beyond collide in a cascade of illumination. 
	The colours were exceptionally vivid even to the naked eye on this occasion –and it was such a privilege to be in a dark enough area to fully enjoy the 
	experience and shoot longer exposures without much light-bleed from the neighbourhood.
