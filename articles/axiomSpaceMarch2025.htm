    <span class="leadLetter">Axiom Space</span> has announced it is partnering with Liverpool City Region and Greater Manchester, working to build a center for innovation in 
    research and manufacturing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Focusing on in-space manufacturing, bio-technology and communications, this partnership will ensure the UK continues to play a leading role in this rapidly growing sector.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the partnership will focus on:
        <ul>
            <li>Space-based communications, AI, and cybersecurity</li>
            <li>Environmental monitoring and disaster management using satellite technology</li>
            <li>Microgravity research in biotech and medicine</li>
            <li>In-space manufacturing for advanced materials and new products</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The agreement builds on discussions between Mayor Rotheram and British astronaut Tim Peake, a strategic advisor to Axiom Space, and discussions between Axiom Space and Mayor 
        Burnham at the South by Southwest festival in 2023. Peake has championed the UK's potential in space-based innovation and has supported efforts to connect scientific research 
        and commercial opportunities with UK regions. 
    </p>
