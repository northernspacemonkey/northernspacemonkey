	<p>
    <span class="leadLetter">Airbus</span> has been given the contract to provide a new military satellite system, Oberon, for the UK Ministry of Defence. 
    The deal worth £127m is anticipated to provide up to 200 skilled jobs in Stevenage and Porstmouth, UK. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Oberon will play a key part in securing critical UK skills in the growing global space sector. The aerospace sector added almost £40 billion 
        to the economy last year, a growth of 50% in the last 10 years, employing tens of thousands of people. 
        The project will also help inform the procurement strategy for future space capability requirements. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Expected to launch in 2027, the satellite system will be able to capture imagery on the ground in daytime and at night. It will be 
        able to capture imagery in any weather condition using two synthetic aperture radar technology satellites. 
	</p>
    <p>
        &quot;This will enable and enhance UK and allied military operations around the world.&quot;, said Major General Paul Tedman, Commander of UK Space Command. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The project is part of the MoD's plan to deliver a constellation of satellites by 2031. Oberon will have advanced imagery sensors, building on the capabilities of Tyche, 
        UK Space Command's first satellite which successfully launched in August last year
    </p>
    <p>
        &quot;This will enable and enhance UK and allied military operations around the world.&quot; said Ben Bridge, airbus defence and space UK chairman.
