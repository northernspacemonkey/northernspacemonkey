        <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Resilience</span> is a lunar lander craft from Japanese company, ispace, which launched on a Falcon 9 earlier this year.
        </p>
        <p>
           Scheduled to land at 19:17 GMT at the Mare Frigoris region on the near side of the moon, the craft appeared to land 45 seconds before the 
           scheduled landing time, with a 187 kilometers per hour speed (much too fast for a safe landing). Telemetry was lost on the live webcast and 
           the company ended the stream 25 minutes later with no updates on the lander status.
        </p>
        <p>
            The company issued a statement several hours after the scheduled landing, acknowledging that Resilience was likely lost. In their statement, ispace 
            stated &quot;The laser rangefinder used to measure the distance to the lunar surface experienced delays in obtaining valid measurement values. As a result, 
            the lander was unable to decelerate sufficiently to reach the required speed for the planned lunar landing. Based on these circumstanes, it is currently 
            assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            ispace continued that &quot;our top priority is to swiftly analyse the telemetry data we have obtained thus far and work diligently to identify the cause&quot;
        </p>        
        <p>
            This problem appears to be a different one to that leading to the failure of the first lander, which was of similar design and crashed in April 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
            Resilience was due to undertake a range of scientific instruments along with Tenacious, a five-kilogram rover developed by ispace's European subsidiary. Two further 
            missions are planned in 2027.
