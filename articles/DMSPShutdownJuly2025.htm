	<p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Weather</span> satellites are key to the prediction of patterns and meteorological event warning for the civilian population. 
        For many years the U.S. Defense Meteorological Satellite Programme (DMSP) and it's data products have supported weather prediction programmes, helping to 
        provide tracking and warning of a range of weather patterns, including hurricane prediction due to the additional microwave imaging unit.
    </p>
    <p>
        In an unexpected change to policy, the satellites have been decomissioned from public usage and access to data services removed for the general public. This has led to the loss 
        of critical tracking data right before the main hurricane season in the U.S. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Citing &quot;recent service changes&quot; as the reason, the world is left speculating around why the out-of-the-blue change has occurred, with other strange 
        announcements around &quot;cyber security risks to the Navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Centre&quot; and not being budget-related.
    </p>
    <p>
       With the shutdown dropped on the community last-minute and slated for the end of June, NOAA further announced a repreave on the 27th June to provide data until the 31st July. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The DMSP will remain in operation for the military for now, however the data will no longer be provided to civilian groups beyond the 31st July.
    </p>
    <p>
        The newer replacement microwave sensor systems (WSF-M , Weather System Follow-on Microwave) will only transmit in encrypted communication channels, removing the ability 
        for hobbyist satellite teams to capture, record and decode the data. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The removal of the data from the DMSP equipment will cause a loss of around 50% of current data feeds used for hurrican prediction - how this will impact the meteorological teams 
        during their busy season will yet to be seen.
