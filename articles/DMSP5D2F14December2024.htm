        <span class="leadLetter">U.S. Military</span> satellite DMSP-5D2 F-14 encountered an unexpected &quot;low-velocity fragmentation event&quot; on December 18th. 
        The 750kg U.S. Military Weather Satellite had fuel and batteries drained during decomissioning in 2020, then left in Sun-synchronous orbit. However, it is part of a family of 
        spacecraft suffering breakup events in Earth orbit. A sister craft, F-12 broke up in October 2016, F-13 in February 2015 and F11 in 2004. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There remains concern that a similar design was used for the NOAA civilian polar-orbiting weather satellites, noting NOAA-16 broke up in 2016 and NOAA-17 broke up in 2021. 
        It appears that the &quot;passivation&quot; process at the end of their lifespan may not be fully effective for these older spacecraft, leading 
        to the unfortunate explosive disassembly we have seen.
    </p>
    <p>
        LeoLabs and Slingshot Aerospace have stated they were tracking the breakup event which at current radar readings notes 50 objects from the fragmentation. 
    </p>
    <p>
        SpaceForce continues to monitor the situation and the potential for debris interaction with other orbital craft or similar debris fields.
