            <span class="leadLetter">SatVu</span>, a U.K. climate science company launched the first of their constellation of satellites in 2023. Several more 
            satellites are due to head into LEO over the next few years. 
            
        </p>
        <p>
            The European Space Agency <a href="https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/announcement-of-opportunity/announcement-of-opportunity-for-hotsat-1">has announced</a> this week that in partnership with SatVu, 
            archive data will be made available for those wanting to undertake Earth Science. With a 3.5m resolution using Mid-wave infrared capture, this offers a fantastic 
            opportunity for anyone wanting to study areas captured in detail.
        </p>
        <p>
            HotSat-1 captured a range of exciting imagery in it's initial tasking before suffering a hardware failure. The replacement unit is due to enter service in 2025, with sister 
            craft arriving shortly after to provide customers with the ability to revisit sites multiple times per day. This will support a range of applications from observing climate change 
            through humanitarian support, city planning and industrial site monitoring.
        </p>
        <p>
            The provision of data to the scientific community comes hot on the heels of announcements of further funding injections to SatVu through a funding round 
            co-led by Adara Ventures and Molten Ventures. With continued support from their existing investors (NOA, Lockheed Martin, Seraphim, Ridgeline and Stellar Ventures), 
            this round of funding brings Â£20M to support the delivery of the next two satellites.
        </p>
        <p>
            SatVu's thermal imaging technology is redefining standards in Earth observation, offering unparallelled insights into global carbon emissions and energy patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            The HotSat-1 Announcement of Opportunity Call is open to users worldwide, with a proposal submission deadline of 30 April 2025. ESA has provided all proposal information 
            through their <a href="http://esatellus.service-now.com/csp?id=esa_catalog_item&sys_id=5c71afd91bac70101c7b6392f54bcb91&ao=92491635c31c9a10e48c7305e40131e2">ESA User Services Portal</a>
