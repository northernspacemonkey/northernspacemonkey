        <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Today</span> marks the 56th anniversary of the 1969 Moon Landing, our first step on another world made at a time where scientific endevour was 
        encouraged, brave men and women stepped into the unknown for the betterment of humanity and engineering was blossoming. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Fifty six years since three men strapped themselves to the biggest pile of explosives and, having watched their friends sadly pass away on the launchpad not long before, launched towards our nearest celestial body. They accepted the risk, 
            they pushed forward, reaching for the stars. 
        </p>
        <p>
           It's with bitter taste therefore, that on the 56th anniversary we see such crushing decline in the investment to NASA, a drive towards &quot;entertainment&quot; and not discovery, 
           and the lack of enthusiasm for selfless pioneering. 
        </p>
        <p>
           The Earth science and deep-space planetary missions have been some of the hardest hit in this year's budget. Understanding our planet and the cosmos is not, it seems, 
           the in-thing. Employees that are watching their missions drop into the cull list are considering partnering with other space agencies to continue their breakthrough scientific work, 
            hoping that they can continue their work elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
           On a weekend where we should be celebrating the heroic efforts to reach-out and engineer a way to other worlds, we see sadness and loss on the picket lines.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is much to celebrate and champion in our reach to place footprints on another world, much to remind us that together we can do great things to the betterment of all. This anniversary, 
            I remember and salute all the engineers, scientists, mathematicians, seamstresses, doctors and interns who worked on a common goal doing their part in a bigger picture. They may not have their own 
            footprint on the moon, but their fingerprints are all over the missions. You made a difference to the bigger mission, turning the impossible dream into an actual reality.
