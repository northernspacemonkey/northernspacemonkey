        <span class="leadLetter">Discovery</span> is the most intact shuttle orbiter of the NASA program, with significant 
        historical value. When it was moved and parked at the national collection it was never anticipated to be moved again. 
        However, in the recently passed US reconcilliation bill, there is a clause requiring the movement of a flown space vehicle to 
        Houston, Texas. That, is unfortunately, marked as Discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no easy way to move Discovery, with transport aircraft out of service and no accessible water transportation available. The 
        only way possible at this stage looks to be the disassembly of the vehicle and reassembly at the other end. On a craft that was never 
        meant to be taken to pieces. With fragile heat tiles and worn airframes.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a letter from the Smithsonian to the Congressional Authorizing and Appropriating Committee they stated:<br/>
        &quot;We remain concerned about the unprecedented nature of a removal of an object from the national collection, 
        and that we would be causing damage to the most intact orbiter from the Space Shuttle program. In particular, 
        irreparable damage to the Shuttle tiles will occur in disassembly, which were critical to the Shuttle's unique reusability.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
        NASA estimates the movement would cost between $120 million and $150 million, excluding the cost of construction for a new 
        building to house the craft, which is considerably higher than the $85 million budgeted for transportation and exhibition construction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lawmakers are attempting to remove the relocation requirement as teams prepare plans for how to move this historic craft must continue.
