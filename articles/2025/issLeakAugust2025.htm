        <span class="leadLetter">Leaking</span> air to space isn't something you want to have happen for long, however it seems the Russian segment on the ISS is, six years later, 
        still encountering issues despite best efforts to stem the flow.
    </p>
    <p>
        The crew aboard the ISS are not in danger at this point, due to ongoing work to find and seal the leaks, however it raises serious questions around sealing-off the section 
        of the ISS that continues to leak which, being that it's in the Service Module Transfer Tunnel, means the loss of a Russian docking port. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The loss of the docking port is not critical, though it is not ideal. The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, would understandably prefer to retain the use of the module for future missions. 
        Roscosmos and NASA continue to track down the root cause of the leak to hopefully seal the module as well as ensure similar issues do not occur on any future missions.
    </p>
    <p>
       Whilst the leak was hoped to have been fixed in recent remedial work, it appears that the loss of air continues, albeit at a slower pace. The rate of loss in 2024 was deemed to be a significant 
       concern, described as a &quot;top safety risk&quot; by NASA.
