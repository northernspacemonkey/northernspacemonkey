        <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">NOAA18</span> has been a favourite of space hobbyists since it's launch in 2005, providing imagery from it's polar orbiting pattern 
        to support meteorological prediction and warning. Transmitting openly on the 137MHz band, it was a go-to satellite for those in the Northern hemisphere interested 
        in getting a live image direct from space on it's pass. 
        </p>
        <p>
           On May 31st, the S-band transmitter, STX4, experienced a power drop from 7W to 0.8W. The only reamining transmitter used for up-link and downlink, this jeaopardized the 
           ability to ensure safe operation of the spacecraft. Based on NOAA's requirement to responsibly manage on-orbit assets, NOAA began the 
           decomissioning of NOAA-18 on June 6th.
        </p>
        <p>
            The decomissioning phase requires the power-down of equipment and the disconnection of batteries, the pointing of solar arrays away from the sun 
            and depletion of any remaining propellant while parking the satellite in a safer, less-congested orbital path. Due to the nature of the propulsion 
            systems it is not possible to safely bring NOAA-18 down, therefore she will remain in a graveyard orbital pattern for the forseeable future.
        </p>
        <p>
           NOAA-18 has suffered several failures of equipment over it's lifespan including the reliance on backup gyroscopes, the loss of communications 
           on it's S-band transmitters and degredation/failure of sensors.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The NOAA-15 and NOAA-19 craft are also due to be classified as &quot;end-of-life&quot; on June 16th, but may continue transmitting data for hobbyists to 
            utilise with the caveat no attempts would be made to rectify equipment failures.
