        <span class="leadLetter">Space</span> is a harsh and difficult environment to operate in, with the potential for problems each orbit. 
        To the teams designing and operating equipment, my greatest admiration and respect for your abilities and greatest sympathy for your losses. 
        </p>
        <p>
           On Friday the 20th June, MethaneSAT mission operations suffered the heart-wrenching loss of contact with their MethaneSAT craft, after fifteen months 
           in orbit. After attempting to re-establish communications with the satellite it became evident that the craft had suffered a power loss which looks to be 
           unrecoverable.
        </p>
        <p>
           The mission has provided a wealth of data on methane emissions over the past year, with it's advanced instrumentation tracking methane emissions in the 
           oil and gas producing regions of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            The spectrometers developed specifically for MethaneSAT met or exceeded expectations throughout it's mission allowing the team to 
            measure volumes of methane emissions from the smallest generation to large-scale installations. The data derived helping to provide a greater 
            overall picture of greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The team at MethaneSAT will continue to analyse the data collected delivering value to customers whilst continuing to understand the nature of the equipment failure.
