        <span class="leadLetter">Long</span> decomissioned satellite, Relay 2 has caught astronomers off guard, emitting a powerful radio pulse with no warning.
        </p>
        <p>
           Relay 2 was launched by NASA in 1964 primarily as an experimental communications device (as it's name implies) although it carried particle experiments designed to 
           map the trapped radiation belt. Relay 2 was physically similar to Relay 1 with two transmitters onboard, one used for PCM telemetry. One of the two transponders 
           operated normally until November 20th, 1966 and ceased functioning on January 20th, 1967. The second transmitter continued to operate until June 9th, 1967
        </p>
        <p>
           On June 13th, 2024, astronomers using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder detected an extraordinarily brief flash of radio waves, lasting only 30 nanoseconds and 
           peaking at over 300kJy. Analysis showed the burst originated not from a new pulsar or stellar object, but within 12,400 miles of Earth. Cross-referencing the orbital data for LEO 
           satellites and objects, the team confirmed Relay 2 as the likely source.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is believed that the long-dead satellite may have accumulated a huge electrostatic charge from it's decades of orbit and suddenly discharged, or that a micrometeorite struck the satellite, 
            vapourising surface materials into a plasma that emitted a radio pulse.
        </p>
        <p>
            Confirming either scenario is a challenge, however it will prove valuable to understand as orbital space becomes increasingly crowded with debris and satellites susceptible to such 
            electrical or collision events.
