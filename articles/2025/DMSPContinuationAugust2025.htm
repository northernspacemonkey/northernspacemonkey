	<p>
        <span class="leadLetter">FNMOC</span> has finally turned around their decision to cease the DMSP data feed at the end of July 2025. After several months of service concerns the 
        Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center has agreed to continue providing data for the duration of the program's lifespan.
    </p>
    <p>
        In an official statement the U.S. Navy spokesman commented &quot;The center [FNMOC] had planned to phase out the data as part of a Defense Department 
        modernization effort. But after feedback from government partners, officials found a way to meet modernization goals while keeping the data flowing until 
        the sensor fails or the program formally ends in September 2026.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
        The continuation of services will leave weather forecasters extremely relieved after concerns over the lack of data through the hheight of the hurricane season. 
    </p>
    <p>
       Despite the data switch-off at times throughout the process, the amateur community rallied to find a way to retrieve data directly from the satellite provided you had 
       sufficient equipment. A decoder was even <a href="https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump" target="SatDump">generated and provided through Github</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next query for the weather teams will be around what happens in 2026 at the end of the program.
