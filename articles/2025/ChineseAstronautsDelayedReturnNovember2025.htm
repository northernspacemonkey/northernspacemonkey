        <span class="leadLetter">Three</span> of China's taikonauts (Wang Jie, Chen Zhongrui and Chen Dong) are currently having an unscheduled extension to their stay 
        aboard the Tiangong space station after their return capsule was struck by space debris.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to return to Earth on Wednesday, the taikonauts have been aboard the space station since April 24th, known as the Shenzhou-20 crew, and recently handing over the baton to the 21 crew. 
        It is likely that they will have to utilise the 21 crew's vehicle for reentry depending on the status of the systems on the damaged delivery vehicle, which is of similar 
        design to the Russian Soyuz capsules.
    </p>
    <p>
        The crews are safe and able to continue operating in orbit at the moment with assessments of the damaged vehicle scheduled to take place. China may decide to send up a replacement 
        craft for the Shenzhou-21 crew and bring the Shenzhou-20 crew back in the currently docked Shenzhou-21 vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's not the first time the Tiangong space station has suffered from orbital debris damage, previously encountereing power system issues with damaged solar arrays. With the quantity of junk, debris and 
        old equipment increasing in Low Earth Orbit, it's no wonder orbital platforms are encountering issues when a speck of paint at orbital velocity can blast through craft.
