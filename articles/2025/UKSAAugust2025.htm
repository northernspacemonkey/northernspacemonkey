	<p>
        <span class="leadLetter">UKSA</span> , the UK Space Agency, is pencilled to collapse into the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology 
        as part of government drives to cut red-tape, &quot;cutting duplication, reducing bureaucracy and putting public accountability at the heart of 
        decision making&quot; (read &quot;reduce cash in government spending&quot; )
    </p>
    <p>
        The DSIT will absorb UKSA by April 2026, sharing staffing but leaving the UKSA name intact. The UKSA was founded in 2010 as an &quot;executive agency&quot; 
        of DSIT and the move to merge into DSIT is in preference to making it a ministry in it's own right. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Companies working with the UKSA are requesting clarification of the government's plans, worried that the wider scientific grouping might lead to 
        the loss of attention to current projects and partnerships. 
    </p>
    <p>
       Sir Chris Bryant, Minister of State for Data Protection and Telecoms (which covers the UKSA) said &quot;You don't need to be a rocket scientist to see the importance of space to the British economy. Bringing things in house means we can bring much 
       greater integration and focus to everything we are doing while maintaining the scientific expertise and the immense ambition of the sector.&quot; 
    </p>
    <p>
        The proof, as always, will be in the pudding... er, merging...
