        <span class="leadLetter">NASA's</span> mission team for the Juno spacecraft executed a repair of the JunoCam imager to capture photographs of the Jovian moon Io in December 2023 it has been revealed.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Nuclear &amp; Space Radiation Effects Conference in Nashville, the repair process and results were detailed to delegates.
        </p>
        <p>
           JunoCam is a colour, visible-light camera that has it's optical unit located outside a titanium-walled radiation vault, which protects sensitive electronic 
           components for many of Juno's engineering and science instruments. The vault is designed to protect against intense planetary radiation fields that Juno travels through 
           in our solar system. Whilst mission designers were confident JunoCam could operate through the first eight orbits of Jupiter, it was uncertain how long the instrument would 
           last after that.
        </p>
        <p>
           Throughout the prime mission of thirty-four orbits, JunoCam operated normally, however on the forty-seventh orbit the imager began showing hints of radiation damage. By the fifty-sixth orbit, 
           almost all of the images were corrupted.
        </p>
        <p>
           The team analysed the output and craft data with clues pointing to a damaged voltage regulator vital to JunoCam's power supply. With very few options for recovery, the team turned to an annealing process, 
           where material is heated for a period of time before slowly cooling. The process is not well understood, however the idea is that heating can reduce defects in a material.
        </p>
        <p>
           The team sent the command to Juno to set the JunoCam heater to raise the camera temperature to 77 degrees Fahrenheit (much warmer than typical for JunoCam) and awaited the results. Soon after the 
           annealing process finished, JunoCam began to deliver crisp images for several orbits.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;After orbit 55, our images were full of streaks and noise, we tried different schemes for processing the images to improve the quality, but nothing worked. With the close encounter of Io bearing down 
            on us in a few weeks, it was Hail Mary time: The only thing left we hadn't tried was to crank JunoCam's heater all the way up and see if the more extreme annealing would save us.&quot; said JunoCam instrument lead, 
            Michael Ravine of Malin Space Science Systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the first week, test images sent back to Earth during the annealing showed little improvement. With the close approach of Io only days away the images began to improve dramatically. As Juno reached 930 miles distance to the moon's surface 
            the images were almost as good as the day the camera launched. Image noise only returned during Juno's seventy-fourth orbit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the first experiments with JunoCam, the mission team has applied derivations of this annealing process on several Juno instruments and engineering subsystems.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lessons learned from this deep-space repair process will be applicable to Earth-orbit satellites as well as other NASA missions as we learn how to create and maintain craft that are tolerant to radiation.
