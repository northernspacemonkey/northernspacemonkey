    <h2>Voyager Updates</h2>
	<div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/voyager.png" class="articleImage" title="A Voyager probe in Space" alt="Artist impression of Voyager probes in space" />
	<p>
    <span class="leadLetter">Voyager 1 and 2</span> have surpassed all expectations on mission longevity, constantly proving the exceptional engineering and mission support put into their projects. 
    Their continued operation in the most extreme conditions have led to several moments where they seemed lost and unrecoverable, before returning to scientific operations to the surprise of us all.
    </p>
    <p>
        To continue further scientific operation with reduced available power, both Voyager 1 and 2, now operating outside of the heliosphere, have had to reduce the number of 
        science instruments powered-up. In continued reduction of power draw, the Cosmic Ray Subsystem was powered-down on Voyager 2 and the Low-Energy Charged Particle Instrument in Voyager 2 will be switched off shortly.
	</p>
    <p>
        The instrument contains two subsystems: the low-energy particle telescope for broader energy measurements, and the low-energy magnetospheric particle analyzer for more focused magnetospheric studies.<br/>
        Both of the systems utilise a rotating platform powered by a stepper motor designed for 360 degree field of view. The motor units were tested to 500,000 steps (to guarantee continuous operation through the mission's 
        encounters with Saturn in 1980) will have completed more than 8.5 million steps by the time it's powered-down on Voyager 2.

            <span class="leadLetter">Recently Declassified</span> satellite imagery has landed on the <a href="https://spacefromspace.com/declassified-satellite-images" target="spacefromspace">SpaceFromSpace Website</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagery from space taken between the 1960's and 1984, now declassified and available for public consumption, is being georeferenced for easier access. This amazing archive of 
                optical imagery provides a wonderful snapshot of time from Earth orbit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Harry Stranger, who started SpaceFromSpace, is on a mission to make satellite data accessible for all. Initially covering spaceports, he has recently been building a large archive of 
                georeferenced and easy-to-view declassified spy satellite imagery.

    <h2>New Airbus Deal for UK MoD</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/oberonMoD.png" class="articleImage" title="Oberon Satellite" alt="Oberon Satellite Image" />
            <p>
                <span class="leadLetter">Airbus</span> has been given the contract to provide a new military satellite system, Oberon, for the UK Ministry of Defence. 
                The deal worth £127m is anticipated to provide up to 200 skilled jobs in Stevenage and Porstmouth, UK. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Oberon will play a key part in securing critical UK skills in the growing global space sector. The aerospace sector added almost £40 billion 
                to the economy last year, a growth of 50% in the last 10 years, employing tens of thousands of people. 
                The project will also help inform the procurement strategy for future space capability requirements. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Expected to launch in 2027, the satellite system will be able to capture imagery on the ground in daytime and at night. It will be 
                able to capture imagery in any weather condition using two synthetic aperture radar technology satellites. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;This will enable and enhance UK and allied military operations around the world.&quot;, said Major General Paul Tedman, Commander of UK Space Command.

    <h2>Meet CroCube, Croatia's first satellite</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/crocubeFeb2025.png" class="articleImage" title="CroCube Satellite" alt="CroCube Satellite" />
        <p>
            <span class="leadLetter">CroCube</span> is the first ever satellite launched by Croatia. The 1U cubesat rode aboard SpaceX Falcon 9 in late December 2024 and measures a 
            tiny 10cm x 10cm x 10cm. Despite the diminutive size the satellite, packed with camera and sensors, broadcast it's first data, imagery and video captured on January 28th. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout it's mission life it will be delivering data to anyone with the mobile app with imagery also making it's way onto their social feeds such as their

            </p>
            <p>
                The $124,000 CroCube is a crowd-funded mission by The Croatian Society for Education Outside the Box, and Czech company Spacemaniac. The primary goal 
                of the 5-year mission is to encourage interest in astronomy and space in Croatia.

    <h2>U.S. Military Weather Satellite breaks up</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/dmsp-5d2-f14.png" class="articleImage" title="DMSP-5D2 F-14 Satellite" alt="DMSP-5D2 F-14 Satellite" />
        <p>
            <span class="leadLetter">U.S. Military</span> satellite DMSP-5D2 F-14 encountered an unexpected &quot;low-velocity fragmentation event&quot; on December 18th. 
            The 750kg U.S. Military Weather Satellite had fuel and batteries drained during decomissioning in 2020, then left in Sun-synchronous orbit. However, it is part of a family of 
            spacecraft suffering breakup events in Earth orbit. A sister craft, F-12 broke up in October 2016, F-13 in February 2015 and F11 in 2004. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There remains concern that a similar design was used for the NOAA civilian polar-orbiting weather satellites, noting NOAA-16 broke up in 2016 and NOAA-17 broke up in 2021. 
            It appears that the &quot;passivation&quot; process at the end of their lifespan may not be fully effective for these older spacecraft, leading 
            to the unfortunate explosive disassembly we have seen.
        </p>
        <p>
            LeoLabs and Slingshot Aerospace have stated they were tracking the breakup event which at current radar readings notes 50 objects from the fragmentation.

        <img src="/img/article/mission/nasawaterdatacenter.png" class="articleImage" title="Water-filled datacenter" alt="Water-filled datacenter" />
	<p>
        <span class="leadLetter">JSOC</span> suffered a burst water pipe in their cooling system this week which caused a shutdown of the datacenter that 
        stores and processes data for two NASA solar observation satellites. 
        
    </p>
    <p>
        The facility at Stanford's Joint Science Operations Center houses the infrastructure handling 
        the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). The datacenter 
        handles data from two of SDO's three scientific instruments: the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) 
        instrument and Atmospheric Imaging Array (AIA). Whilst the data is still being collected from the craft, it 
        cannot be processed and delivered until the datacenter has dried-out, damage assessed and repaired and the 
        systems brought back into service.

    <h2>SatVu and ESA provide EO data for science</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/hotsat_refinery.png" class="articleImage" title="HotSat-1 Refinery Capture" alt="HotSat-1 Refinery Capture" />
	<p>
        <span class="leadLetter">SatVu</span>, a U.K. climate science company, launched the first of their constellation of satellites in 2023. Several more 
        satellites are due to head into LEO over the next few years. 
        
    </p>
    <p>
        The European Space Agency <a href="https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/announcement-of-opportunity/announcement-of-opportunity-for-hotsat-1">has announced</a> this week that in partnership with SatVu, 
        archive data will be made available for those wanting to undertake Earth Science. With a 3.5m resolution using Mid-wave infrared capture, this offers a fantastic 
        opportunity for anyone wanting to study areas captured in detail.
    </p>
    <p>
        HotSat-1 captured a range of exciting imagery in it's initial tasking before suffering a hardware failure. The replacement unit is due to enter service in 2025, with sister 
        craft arriving shortly after to provide customers with the ability to revisit sites multiple times per day. This will support a range of applications from observing climate change 
        through humanitarian support, city planning and industrial site monitoring.
    </p>
    <p>
        The provision of data to the scientific community comes hot on the heels of announcements of further funding injections to SatVu.
