    <h2>Resilience Lunar Lander</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/resilienceLander.png" class="articleImage" title="Resilience Lander" alt="Resilience Lander" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Resilience</span> is a lunar lander craft from Japanese company, ispace, which launched on a Falcon 9 earlier this year.
        </p>
        <p>
           Scheduled to land at 19:17 GMT at the Mare Frigoris region on the near side of the moon, the craft appeared to land 45 seconds before the 
           scheduled landing time, with a 187 kilometers per hour speed (much too fast for a safe landing). Telemetry was lost on the live webcast and 
           the company ended the stream 25 minutes later with no updates on the lander status.
        </p>
        <p>
            The company issued a statement several hours after the scheduled landing, acknowledging that Resilience was likely lost. In their statement, ispace 
            stated &quot;The laser rangefinder used to measure the distance to the lunar surface experienced delays in obtaining valid measurement values. As a result, 
            the lander was unable to decelerate sufficiently to reach the required speed for the planned lunar landing. Based on these circumstanes, it is currently 
            assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            ispace continued that &quot;our top priority is to swiftly analyse the telemetry data we have obtained thus far and work diligently to identify the cause&quot;

    <h2>Voyager 1 Thruster Revival</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/voyager.png" class="articleImage" title="A Voyager probe in Space" alt="Artist impression of Voyager probe in space" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Voyager 1</span> suffered a failure of one set of thrusters back in 2004 due to a power loss in a set of internal heaters, 
    leading to a switch to a backup set for the roll motion on the spacecraft. At the time, the engineers decided to leave the failed system alone and 
    switch to the backup as the mission had already surpassed expectations of lifespan. They certainly had not envisaged another twenty years of operation that we've been graced with. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Running for the last twenty years without a backup in place, the team decided to reexamine the issue and try to derive a solution to ensure a backup set of 
        roll thrusters were available in case of failure of the now primary system. In the event of failure of the primary, Voyager would not be able to remain pointed at it's guide star used to orient itself. 
	</p>
    <p>
        With a shutdown of the Deep Space Station 43 antenna in Canberra for maintenance, the mission team raced against the clock to create a solution and communicate with Voyager 1 before loss of constant contact.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a review of flight data the team surmised that the power supply for the heaters had flipped a switch to the wrong position, and a reversal of this 
        could lead to a restoration of power to the heaters. The team needed to switch the old roll thrusters back on, then fix and restart heaters. However, if Voyager decided it had drifted too far 
        from it's alignment, the thrusters could fire and cause a small explosion due to the frozen fuel lines.

    <h2>Kosmos 482 Reentry</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/kosmos482.png" class="articleImage" title="Kosmos482 Capsule" alt="Kosmos 482 Soviet-era capsule and cutaway diagram" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Reentry</span> is inevitable for anything failing to escape the gravitational pull of our planet. The process of falling back to Earth may take minutes, days, weeks or years - but the guarantee is there; If you don't 
    escape the pull back, you'll be meeting a lot of atmosphere at high speed at some point. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In March 1972, Russia launched a Molniya rocket with a capsule, Kosmos 482, bound for our neighbour, Venus. The mission brief, as other previous launches, was 
        to enter a parking orbit around Earth and then fire engines to intercept Venus at the right moment. However, the escape from Earth failed - most likely due to a 
        premature engine shutdown. Part of the original launch vehicle made it back to Earth in 1981 and 1983, however, since 1972, part of it has been orbiting Earth - likely the descent sphere due to the size on radar.
    </p>
    <p>
        Originally the probe would have descended on a parachute mechanism (which will now be non-functional), allowing a controlled descent of the half-ton probe. Whilst Earth's atmosphere has the 
        capability to vapourise the capsule at the velocity it will reenter at, the heat shield on the probe designed to protect it on descent to Venus could offer protection as it descends. This could provide the 
        half-ton sphere a chance of making it to the ground mostly intact, leaving a sizable crater in the ground / your house / your garden when it impacts at around 150mph.

    <h2>ESA Biomass Mission Launches</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/esa_biomass.png" class="articleImage" title="ESA" alt="ESA Biomass Satellite" />
        <p>
            <span class="leadLetter">Biomass</span>, the ESA mission to deliver crucial information about the state of our forests and how they are changing, successfully launched from Kourou in French Guiana on the 29th April aboard a Vega-C rocket. 
            </p>
            <p>
                An unusual-looking umbrella-like antenna of 12m in diameter sits atop the 1250kg satellite which operates the first P-band radar in space.
            </p>
            <p>
                The P-band synthetic aperture radar can penetrate through the forest canopy to measure the 'biomass' (woody trunks, branches and stems) where trees store most of their carbon, 
                helping scientists quantify the stored carbon in our forests. This will further reduce major uncertainties in calculations of carbon stocks and fluxes on land, 
                including carbon fluxes associated with land-use change, forest degredation and forest regrowth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Optical sensors can only offer a picture of the forest extent from the top of the canopy, with cloud cover further limiting data collection, however the Biomass satellite's 
                P-band synthetic aperture not only 'sees' through cloud cover, it slices through the whole forest layer. The signal scattered back to the satellite carries information about the forest 
                structure that can be used to infer parameters such as forest biomass and forest height.

    <h2>ACES installed on the ISS</h2>
	<div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/aces.png" class="articleImage" title="Atomic Clock" alt="Atomic Clock Image" />
        <p>
            <span class="leadLetter">ACES</span> (Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space) has been successfully installed on the International Space Station. The European Space Agency's state-of-the-art time keeping facility 
            was lifted into orbit on the 21st April aboard SpaceX's Falcon 9. On Saturday 25th April, the ISS Canadian Arm installed the payload onto the Earth-facing side of ESA's Columbus laboratory pod. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Developed by ESA in collaboration with European industry led by Airbus, ACES carries the most accurate atomic timepiece ever launched into space, PHARAO (a cesium-based fountain clock developed by 
                French space agency, CNES); and the Space Hydrogen Maser, built by Safran Timing Technologies in Switzerland.
            </p>
            <p>
                The onboard clocks will work in tandem with a cutting-edge microwave and laser link system, to deliver time from orbit achieving a precision of one part in 10<sup>17</sup>, 
                or about 10 quintillionths of a second, within just a few days of connecting to multiple ground station clocks. This is between one and two orders of magnitude better than today's systems using navigation satellites such as GPS.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mission will explore the nature of time, test general relativity, and help pave the way for a redefinition of the second based on next-generation optical clocks

    <h2>Voyager Updates</h2>

        <img src="/img/article/mission/voyager.png" class="articleImage" title="A Voyager probe in Space" alt="Artist impression of Voyager probes in space" />
	<p>
    <span class="leadLetter">Voyager 1 and 2</span> have surpassed all expectations on mission longevity, constantly proving the exceptional engineering and mission support put into their projects. 
    Their continued operation in the most extreme conditions have led to several moments where they seemed lost and unrecoverable, before returning to scientific operations to the surprise of us all.
    </p>
    <p>
        To continue further scientific operation with reduced available power, both Voyager 1 and 2, now operating outside of the heliosphere, have had to reduce the number of 
        science instruments powered-up. In continued reduction of power draw, the Cosmic Ray Subsystem was powered-down on Voyager 2 and the Low-Energy Charged Particle Instrument in Voyager 2 will be switched off shortly.
	</p>
    <p>
        The instrument contains two subsystems: the low-energy particle telescope for broader energy measurements, and the low-energy magnetospheric particle analyzer for more focused magnetospheric studies.<br/>
        Both of the systems utilise a rotating platform powered by a stepper motor designed for 360 degree field of view. The motor units were tested to 500,000 steps (to guarantee continuous operation through the mission's 
        encounters with Saturn in 1980) will have completed more than 8.5 million steps by the time it's powered-down on Voyager 2.

                The project will also help inform the procurement strategy for future space capability requirements. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Expected to launch in 2027, the satellite system will be able to capture imagery on the ground in daytime and at night. It will be 
                able to capture imagery in any weather condition using two synthetic aperture radar technology satellites. 
            </p>
            <p>
