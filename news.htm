    <h2>Anniversary of the Moon Landing</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/moon1969.png" class="articleImage" title="Moon Landing" alt="Moon Landing" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Today</span> marks the 56th anniversary of the 1969 Moon Landing, our first step on another world made at a time where scientific endevour was 
        encouraged, brave men and women stepped into the unknown for the betterment of humanity and engineering was blossoming. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Fifty six years since three men strapped themselves to the biggest pile of explosives and, having watched their friends sadly pass away on the launchpad not long before, launched towards our nearest celestial body. They accepted the risk, 
            they pushed forward, reaching for the stars. 
        </p>
        <p>
           It's with bitter taste therefore, that on the 56th anniversary we see such crushing decline in the investment to NASA, a drive towards &quot;entertainment&quot; and not discovery, 
           and the lack of enthusiasm for selfless pioneering. 
        </p>
        <p>
           The Earth science and deep-space planetary missions have been some of the hardest hit in this year's budget. Understanding our planet and the cosmos is not, it seems, 
           the in-thing. Employees that are watching their missions drop into the cull list are considering partnering with other space agencies to continue their breakthrough scientific work, 
            hoping that they can continue their work elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
           On a weekend where we should be celebrating the heroic efforts to reach-out and engineer a way to other worlds, we see sadness and loss on the picket lines.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is much to celebrate and champion in our reach to place footprints on another world, much to remind us that together we can do great things to the betterment of all. This anniversary, 
            I remember and salute all the engineers, scientists, mathematicians, seamstresses, doctors and interns who worked on a common goal doing their part in a bigger picture. They may not have their own 
            footprint on the moon, but their fingerprints are all over the missions. You made a difference to the bigger mission, turning the impossible dream into an actual reality.

    <h2>U.S. Military Weather Satellite Shutdown</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/dmsp-5d2-f14.png" class="articleImage" title="DMSP Satellite" alt="DMSP Satellite" />
        <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Weather</span> satellites are key to the prediction of patterns and meteorological event warning for the civilian population. 
        For many years the U.S. Defense Meteorological Satellite Programme (DMSP) and it's data products have supported weather prediction programmes, helping to 
        provide tracking and warning of a range of weather patterns, including hurricane prediction due to the additional microwave imaging unit.
    </p>
    <p>
        In an unexpected change to policy, the satellites have been decomissioned from public usage and access to data services removed for the general public. This has led to the loss 
        of critical tracking data right before the main hurricane season in the U.S. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Citing &quot;recent service changes&quot; as the reason, the world is left speculating around why the out-of-the-blue change has occurred, with other strange 
        announcements around &quot;cyber security risks to the Navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Centre&quot; and not being budget-related.
    </p>
    <p>
       With the shutdown dropped on the community last-minute and slated for the end of June, NOAA further announced a repreave on the 27th June to provide data until the 31st July.

    <h2>MethaneSAT Loses Contact with Satellite</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/methanesat.png" class="articleImage" title="MethaneSAT Satellite" alt="MethaneSAT Satellite" />
        <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Space</span> is a harsh and difficult environment to operate in, with the potential for problems each orbit. 
        To the teams designing and operating equipment, my greatest admiration and respect for your abilities and greatest sympathy for your losses. 
        </p>
        <p>
           On Friday the 20th June, MethaneSAT mission operations suffered the heart-wrenching loss of contact with their MethaneSAT craft, after fifteen months 
           in orbit. After attempting to re-establish communications with the satellite it became evident that the craft had suffered a power loss which looks to be 
           unrecoverable.
        </p>
        <p>
           The mission has provided a wealth of data on methane emissions over the past year, with it's advanced instrumentation tracking methane emissions in the 
           oil and gas producing regions of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            The spectrometers developed specifically for MethaneSAT met or exceeded expectations throughout it's mission allowing the team to 
            measure volumes of methane emissions from the smallest generation to large-scale installations. The data derived helping to provide a greater 
            overall picture of greenhouse gas emissions.

    <h2>Dead Relay 2 Satellite Emits Radio Pulse</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/relay2.png" class="articleImage" title="Relay 2 Satellite" alt="Relay 2 Satellite" />
        <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Long</span> decomissioned satellite, Relay 2 has caught astronomers off guard, emitting a powerful radio pulse with no warning.
        </p>
        <p>
           Relay 2 was launched by NASA in 1964 primarily as an experimental communications device (as it's name implies) although it carried particle experiments designed to 
           map the trapped radiation belt. Relay 2 was physically similar to Relay 1 with two transmitters onboard, one used for PCM telemetry. One of the two transponders 
           operated normally until November 20th, 1966 and ceased functioning on January 20th, 1967. The second transmitter continued to operate until June 9th, 1967
        </p>
        <p>
           On June 13th, 2024, astronomers using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder detected an extraordinarily brief flash of radio waves, lasting only 30 nanoseconds and 
           peaking at over 300kJy. Analysis showed the burst originated not from a new pulsar or stellar object, but within 12,400 miles of Earth. Cross-referencing the orbital data for LEO 
           satellites and objects, the team confirmed Relay 2 as the likely source.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is believed that the long-dead satellite may have accumulated a huge electrostatic charge from it's decades of orbit and suddenly discharged, or that a micrometeorite struck the satellite, 
            vapourising surface materials into a plasma that emitted a radio pulse.

    <h2>Starlink Failures due to Solar Activity</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/nature/solarFlare.png" class="articleImage" title="Solar Flare" alt="Solar Flare" />
        <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Starlink</span> satellites have been known to cause radio astronomers pain due to their electromagnetic output across the sky, 
        however it appears from a NASA study that they are having bother with EM output themselves of a different kind.
        </p>
        <p>
           Led by space physicist, Denny Oliveira of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, a study of the failure rates of Starlink satellites revealed a 
           distinct pattern. As the Sun escalated towards the peak of it's activity between 2020 and 2024, the number of satellite falls increased as a direct result 
           of that activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;We clearly show that the intense solar activity of the current solar cycle has already had significant impacts on Starlink reentries&quot; 
        </p>
        <p>
            The solar cycle is an 11-year pattern of fluctuations in the Sun's activity, centering around the periodic magnetic reversal of the solar poles. The recent 
            cycle has been particularly stong, as evidenced by the higher quantity of visible auroras recently. The additional effect is that solar energy hitting our upper 
            atmosphere leads to an increase in drag on spacecraft in low-Earth orbit.

    <h2>NOAA-18 Decommission</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
         <img src="/img/article/mission/noaa18.png" class="articleImage" title="NOAA18 and Imagery" alt="NOAA18 and Imagery" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">NOAA18</span> has been a favourite of space hobbyists since it's launch in 2005, providing imagery from it's polar orbiting pattern 
        to support meteorological prediction and warning. Transmitting openly on the 137MHz band, it was a go-to satellite for those in the Northern hemisphere interested 
        in getting a live image direct from space on it's pass. 
        </p>
        <p>
           On May 31st, the S-band transmitter, STX4, experienced a power drop from 7W to 0.8W. The only reamining transmitter used for up-link and downlink, this jeaopardized the 
           ability to ensure safe operation of the spacecraft. Based on NOAA's requirement to responsibly manage on-orbit assets, NOAA began the 
           decomissioning of NOAA-18 on June 6th.
        </p>
        <p>
            The decomissioning phase requires the power-down of equipment and the disconnection of batteries, the pointing of solar arrays away from the sun 
            and depletion of any remaining propellant while parking the satellite in a safer, less-congested orbital path. Due to the nature of the propulsion 
            systems it is not possible to safely bring NOAA-18 down, therefore she will remain in a graveyard orbital pattern for the forseeable future.

    <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/resilienceLander.png" class="articleImage" title="Resilience Lander" alt="Resilience Lander" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Resilience</span> is a lunar lander craft from Japanese company, ispace, which launched on a Falcon 9 earlier this year.
        </p>
        <p>
           Scheduled to land at 19:17 GMT at the Mare Frigoris region on the near side of the moon, the craft appeared to land 45 seconds before the 
           scheduled landing time, with a 187 kilometers per hour speed (much too fast for a safe landing). Telemetry was lost on the live webcast and 
           the company ended the stream 25 minutes later with no updates on the lander status.
        </p>
        <p>
            The company issued a statement several hours after the scheduled landing, acknowledging that Resilience was likely lost. In their statement, ispace 
            stated &quot;The laser rangefinder used to measure the distance to the lunar surface experienced delays in obtaining valid measurement values. As a result, 
            the lander was unable to decelerate sufficiently to reach the required speed for the planned lunar landing. Based on these circumstanes, it is currently 
            assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            ispace continued that &quot;our top priority is to swiftly analyse the telemetry data we have obtained thus far and work diligently to identify the cause&quot;

    <h2>Voyager 1 Thruster Revival</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/voyager.png" class="articleImage" title="A Voyager probe in Space" alt="Artist impression of Voyager probe in space" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Voyager 1</span> suffered a failure of one set of thrusters back in 2004 due to a power loss in a set of internal heaters, 
    leading to a switch to a backup set for the roll motion on the spacecraft. At the time, the engineers decided to leave the failed system alone and 
    switch to the backup as the mission had already surpassed expectations of lifespan. They certainly had not envisaged another twenty years of operation that we've been graced with. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Running for the last twenty years without a backup in place, the team decided to reexamine the issue and try to derive a solution to ensure a backup set of 
        roll thrusters were available in case of failure of the now primary system. In the event of failure of the primary, Voyager would not be able to remain pointed at it's guide star used to orient itself. 
	</p>
    <p>
        With a shutdown of the Deep Space Station 43 antenna in Canberra for maintenance, the mission team raced against the clock to create a solution and communicate with Voyager 1 before loss of constant contact.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a review of flight data the team surmised that the power supply for the heaters had flipped a switch to the wrong position, and a reversal of this 
        could lead to a restoration of power to the heaters. The team needed to switch the old roll thrusters back on, then fix and restart heaters. However, if Voyager decided it had drifted too far 
        from it's alignment, the thrusters could fire and cause a small explosion due to the frozen fuel lines.

    <h2>Kosmos 482 Reentry</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/kosmos482.png" class="articleImage" title="Kosmos482 Capsule" alt="Kosmos 482 Soviet-era capsule and cutaway diagram" />
    <p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Reentry</span> is inevitable for anything failing to escape the gravitational pull of our planet. The process of falling back to Earth may take minutes, days, weeks or years - but the guarantee is there; If you don't 
    escape the pull back, you'll be meeting a lot of atmosphere at high speed at some point. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In March 1972, Russia launched a Molniya rocket with a capsule, Kosmos 482, bound for our neighbour, Venus. The mission brief, as other previous launches, was 
        to enter a parking orbit around Earth and then fire engines to intercept Venus at the right moment. However, the escape from Earth failed - most likely due to a 
        premature engine shutdown. Part of the original launch vehicle made it back to Earth in 1981 and 1983, however, since 1972, part of it has been orbiting Earth - likely the descent sphere due to the size on radar.
    </p>
    <p>
        Originally the probe would have descended on a parachute mechanism (which will now be non-functional), allowing a controlled descent of the half-ton probe. Whilst Earth's atmosphere has the 
        capability to vapourise the capsule at the velocity it will reenter at, the heat shield on the probe designed to protect it on descent to Venus could offer protection as it descends. This could provide the 
        half-ton sphere a chance of making it to the ground mostly intact, leaving a sizable crater in the ground / your house / your garden when it impacts at around 150mph.

    <h2>ESA Biomass Mission Launches</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/esa_biomass.png" class="articleImage" title="ESA" alt="ESA Biomass Satellite" />
        <p>
            <span class="leadLetter">Biomass</span>, the ESA mission to deliver crucial information about the state of our forests and how they are changing, successfully launched from Kourou in French Guiana on the 29th April aboard a Vega-C rocket. 
            </p>
            <p>
                An unusual-looking umbrella-like antenna of 12m in diameter sits atop the 1250kg satellite which operates the first P-band radar in space.
            </p>
            <p>
                The P-band synthetic aperture radar can penetrate through the forest canopy to measure the 'biomass' (woody trunks, branches and stems) where trees store most of their carbon, 
                helping scientists quantify the stored carbon in our forests. This will further reduce major uncertainties in calculations of carbon stocks and fluxes on land, 
                including carbon fluxes associated with land-use change, forest degredation and forest regrowth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Optical sensors can only offer a picture of the forest extent from the top of the canopy, with cloud cover further limiting data collection, however the Biomass satellite's 
                P-band synthetic aperture not only 'sees' through cloud cover, it slices through the whole forest layer. The signal scattered back to the satellite carries information about the forest 
                structure that can be used to infer parameters such as forest biomass and forest height.

    <h2>ACES installed on the ISS</h2>
	<div class="columnDiv">

        <p>
            <span class="leadLetter">ACES</span> (Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space) has been successfully installed on the International Space Station. The European Space Agency's state-of-the-art time keeping facility 
            was lifted into orbit on the 21st April aboard SpaceX's Falcon 9. On Saturday 25th April, the ISS Canadian Arm installed the payload onto the Earth-facing side of ESA's Columbus laboratory pod. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Developed by ESA in collaboration with European industry led by Airbus, ACES carries the most accurate atomic timepiece ever launched into space, PHARAO (a cesium-based fountain clock developed by 
                French space agency, CNES); and the Space Hydrogen Maser, built by Safran Timing Technologies in Switzerland.
            </p>
            <p>
                The onboard clocks will work in tandem with a cutting-edge microwave and laser link system, to deliver time from orbit achieving a precision of one part in 10<sup>17</sup>, 
                or about 10 quintillionths of a second, within just a few days of connecting to multiple ground station clocks. This is between one and two orders of magnitude better than today's systems using navigation satellites such as GPS.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mission will explore the nature of time, test general relativity, and help pave the way for a redefinition of the second based on next-generation optical clocks

        Focusing on in-space manufacturing, bio-technology and communications, this partnership will ensure the UK continues to play a leading role in this rapidly growing sector.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the partnership will focus on:
        <ul>
            <li>Space-based communications, AI, and cybersecurity</li>
            <li>Environmental monitoring and disaster management using satellite technology</li>
            <li>Microgravity research in biotech and medicine</li>
            <li>In-space manufacturing for advanced materials and new products</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The agreement builds on discussions between Mayor Rotheram and British astronaut Tim Peake, a strategic advisor to Axiom Space, and discussions between Axiom Space and Mayor 
        Burnham at the South by Southwest festival in 2023. Peake has championed the UK's potential in space-based innovation and has supported efforts to connect scientific research 
        and commercial opportunities with UK regions.

        Axiom Space is the principal provider of commercial human spaceflight services, including missions to the International Space Station. It is developing the world's 
        first commercial space station, known as &quot;Axiom Station&quot;, fostering groundbreaking innovation and research in microgravity. Axiom is also a developer of advanced spacesuits 
        for the Moon and low-Earth orbit.

    <h2>Voyager Updates</h2>

	<p>
    <span class="leadLetter">Voyager 1 and 2</span> have surpassed all expectations on mission longevity, constantly proving the exceptional engineering and mission support put into their projects. 
    Their continued operation in the most extreme conditions have led to several moments where they seemed lost and unrecoverable, before returning to scientific operations to the surprise of us all.
    </p>
    <p>
        To continue further scientific operation with reduced available power, both Voyager 1 and 2, now operating outside of the heliosphere, have had to reduce the number of 
        science instruments powered-up. In continued reduction of power draw, the Cosmic Ray Subsystem was powered-down on Voyager 2 and the Low-Energy Charged Particle Instrument in Voyager 2 will be switched off shortly.
	</p>
    <p>
        The instrument contains two subsystems: the low-energy particle telescope for broader energy measurements, and the low-energy magnetospheric particle analyzer for more focused magnetospheric studies.<br/>
        Both of the systems utilise a rotating platform powered by a stepper motor designed for 360 degree field of view. The motor units were tested to 500,000 steps (to guarantee continuous operation through the mission's 
        encounters with Saturn in 1980) will have completed more than 8.5 million steps by the time it's powered-down on Voyager 2.
