    <h2>Solar Dynamics datacenter flooded</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/nasawaterdatacenter.png" class="articleImage" title="Water-filled datacenter" alt="Water-filled datacenter" />
	<p>
        <span class="leadLetter">JSOC</span> suffered a burst water pipe in their cooling system this week which caused a shutdown of the datacenter that 
        stores and processes data for two NASA solar observation satellites. 
        
    </p>
    <p>
        The facility at Stanford's Joint Science Operations Center houses the infrastructure handling 
        the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). The datacenter 
        handles data from two of SDO's three scientific instruments: the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) 
        instrument and Atmospheric Imaging Array (AIA). Whilst the data is still being collected from the craft, it 
        cannot be processed and delivered until the datacenter has dried-out, damage assessed and repaired and the 
        systems brought back into service.
    </p>
    <p>
        JSOC is providing updated information on their <a href="https://solarweb1.stanford.edu/JSOC_Emergency_Resources.html">solarweb site</a> with no current 
        indication on how long it will take to bring the systems back online.

    <h2>SatVu and ESA provide EO data for science</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/hotsat_refinery.png" class="articleImage" title="HotSat-1 Refinery Capture" alt="HotSat-1 Refinery Capture" />
	<p>
        <span class="leadLetter">SatVu</span>, a U.K. climate science company, launched the first of their constellation of satellites in 2023. Several more 
        satellites are due to head into LEO over the next few years. 
        
    </p>
    <p>
        The European Space Agency <a href="https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/announcement-of-opportunity/announcement-of-opportunity-for-hotsat-1">has announced</a> this week that in partnership with SatVu, 
        archive data will be made available for those wanting to undertake Earth Science. With a 3.5m resolution using Mid-wave infrared capture, this offers a fantastic 
        opportunity for anyone wanting to study areas captured in detail.
    </p>
    <p>
        HotSat-1 captured a range of exciting imagery in it's initial tasking before suffering a hardware failure. The replacement unit is due to enter service in 2025, with sister 
        craft arriving shortly after to provide customers with the ability to revisit sites multiple times per day. This will support a range of applications from observing climate change 
        through humanitarian support, city planning and industrial site monitoring.
    </p>
    <p>
        The provision of data to the scientific community comes hot on the heels of announcements of further funding injections to SatVu.

    <h2>Boeing Satellite Intelsat-33e Failure</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
        <img src="/img/article/mission/boeingsat33e.png" class="articleImage" title="Boeing Intelsat 33e" alt="Intelsat 33e" />
	<p>
        <span class="leadLetter">Boeing</span> isn't having an easy year with the failure of the Starliner crew transport earlier this year 
        and now the sudden and unexpected spontaneous destruction of the Intelsat-33e communications platform, leading to a mess of at least 
        twenty new space debris items on tracking. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The satellite, designed as a geostationary communications platform, had suffered problems with the propulsion system since entering 
        orbit in late August 2016, leading to three and a half years reduction in lifespan on the estimated fifteen-year mission length. The 
        satellite was part of the Intelsat Epic high throughput satellite (HTS) series based on the 702MP satellite bus. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This falls hot-on-the-heels of propulsion system issues on Starliner and the loss of Intelsat-29e in 2019 caused by &quot;either meteoroid impact or a wiring flaw 
        in conjunction with an electrostatic event related to solar weather activity&quot;.

    <h2>Europa Clipper</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">
	<img src="/img/article/mission/europaclipperOct2024.png" class="articleImage" title="Aurora Borealis" alt="Aurora Borealis Image from 10th October 2024" />
    <p>
    <span class="leadLetter">NASA</span> launched it's Europa Clipper mission on the 14th October after a nervous post-hurricane check of the launch site. The mission will reach Europa to begin it's scientific study in 2030 after 
    travelling 1.8 billion miles. The Europa Clipper is the largest spacecraft NASA has ever developed for a planetary mission, due in part to the huge solar arrays and radar antennas necessary to capture 
    solar energy to power it at five times the distance from the Sun as here on Earth.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mission goal is to investigate Europa in much more detail using spectrometers and high-resolution imagery, as well as ice-penetrating radar to 
        search for subsurface water. Magnetometers, gravity measurements and thermal instruments will also discover clues about it's ocean and deep interior.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mission is not without significant challenges as the Europa Clipper payload and other electronics will be subjected to high radiation trapped in Jupiter's magnetic field. 
        The systems have been encased in a thick-walled vault made of titanium and aluminium to act as a radiation shield, slowing-down the degredation of the electronics.

    <h2>Aurora Borealis</h2>
    <div class="columnDiv">

	<p>
    <span class="leadLetter">This</span> October in the northern hemisphere we were provided an amazing aurora display on the evening of the 10th. 
	In previous scheduled viewing periods it always seemed to transpire that the skies were filled with rainclouds for me, but this year I finally managed 
	to get some photographs of the event. Iâ€™ve always wanted to head further northward to experience the phenomenon in full, somewhere like Lapland with the 
	stark beauty of the landscape and the vast beyond collide in a cascade of illumination. 
	The colours were exceptionally vivid even to the naked eye on this occasion, and it was such a privilege to be in a dark enough area to fully enjoy the 
	experience and shoot longer exposures without much light-bleed from the neighbourhood.
	</p>
    <p>
        The main display for my location was around 10pm BST, with a burst of red and green in the sky visible to the naked eye, as well as through 
        longer exposure on your camera. The coronal mass ejection from the sun, which happened on the 9th October, travelled at almost 2.4 million kilometers per hour 
        and registered as a G4 on the NOAA weather scale. <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-storm-watch-10-11-october" target="_NOAA">[ NOAA Report ]</a>
